# Habit Tracker

A group project to learn how to make mobile apps using React Native. The app is a habit tracker that allows users to create habits and track their progress. The app will also have a social aspect where users can share their progress with friends.

## Getting Started

This project uses React Native with Expo, with Supabase as the primary backend service.

To setup your development environment, create a .env file based on the .env.example file. Then run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Install the Expo app on your phone, then scan the QR code created by the commands above.
