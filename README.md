# Habits Together

## Summary

A habit tracking app for Apple and Android where you can add friends and do habits together. Created using React Native and Firebase.

## Development: Getting Started

Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Install the Expo Go app on your phone, then scan the QR code that shows up in the terminal. 

More information about Expo Go: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/

## Debugging

If you can't run Expo Go and errors keep showing up, try running the following commands:

```
npm prune
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

This syncs the installed packages with `package.json` to remove any problematic packages that might be breaking something, and makes sure all required packages are installed. Running expo start with the clear flag clears expo's cache.
